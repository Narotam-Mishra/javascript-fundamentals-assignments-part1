// Consider the following code snippet with poorly named variables:

let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

/*
This code is functional, but it lacks clarity. Without context, it's not immediately clear what `x`, `y`, and `z` represent.

Now, let's improve the code by using more meaningful variable names:
*/

let numberOfApples = 10;
let numberOfOranges = 20;
let totalFruits = numberOfApples + numberOfOranges;

/*
In this improved version, the variables are named in a way that clearly communicates their purpose. It's now evident that `numberOfApples` and `numberOfOranges` represent quantities, and `totalFruits` holds the sum of both.
