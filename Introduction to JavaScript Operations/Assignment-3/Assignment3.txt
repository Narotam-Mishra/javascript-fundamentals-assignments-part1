Question 3 - Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

# Ans - Unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript are categorized based on the number of operands they operate on.

1). Unary Operators :-
# Unary operators work on a single operand (one value or variable). They perform operations like negation, incrementing, decrementing, and type conversions.

# Examples :-

a). ++ (Increment): Increases the value of a variable by 1.
b). -- (Decrement): Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
c). + (Unary plus): Attempts to convert a value to a number.
4). - (Unary minus): Negates a numeric value.

2). Binary Operators :-
# Binary operators work on two operands (two values or variables). They perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparisons.

# Examples :-

a). + (Addition): Adds two values.
b). - (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
c). * (Multiplication): Multiplies two values.
d). / (Division): Divides the first operand by the second.
e). == (Equality): Compares two values for equality.

3). Ternary Operator :-
# The ternary operator, ? :, is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It's a conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on whether the condition is true or false.

# In summary :-
1). Unary operators work on one operand.
2). Binary operators work on two operands.
3). Ternary operator (? :) is the only operator that works on three operands.

# Understanding these different types of operators allows you to effectively manipulate data and control the flow of your programs in JavaScript.
